DESCRIPTION
===========

   The library will be provide a few function for the thinkpad notebooks. At 
the moment you can use two function to use the light above the screen. With 
one the light blinks at customs intervalls. The other is more intersting, 
because you can morse a character and strings. 

INSTALL
=======

   Now there are two ways to compile the program (static and dynamic). I
recommend the static way.

0. Compiling both versions

   If you want test both version use 'make all'. To start the dynamic version
   you need to set the environment variable ('source env-update')

1. Compile statically

   Start the compiling process with 'make static'. If the compiling finish
   without errors you can use the test program (./thinkpadTestDynamic).

   Use 'make static && ./thinkpadTestStatic' to make all in one step (optional
   are parameters, without parameters you see a short help).

2. Compile dynamically
  
   Start the compiling process with 'make dynamic'. If the compiling finish
   without errors you must set-up the environment variables. Use for this
   purpose 'source env-update'. Than you can use the test program
   (./thinkpadTestDynamic).

   Use 'make dynamic && source env-update && ./thinkpadTestDynamic' to make
   all in one step (optional are parameters, without parameters you see a
   short help).


TODO
====

x Make than a library (dynamic and static). [DONE]
x Document the whole project.
- Implemnt also the other features of the thinkpad notebook (not only the
  light).
- Don't use the file in the /proc file, use the driver directly.
- Extract the hardware specific part from the functions.
- Split the files into one file per feature (ad example one for the light, one
  for the background light, ...)
- Make a ebuild (gentoo) for the library
- ...
