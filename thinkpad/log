	* trunk/libthinkpad.c:
	* trunk/libthinkpad.h:
	Renaming the file thinkpad.c and thikpad.h to libthinkpad.c and
	libthinkpad.h.

	* trunk/Makefile:
	Splitting the compiling process into two parts. One for a static
	testing program and one for a dynamic.
	Adding also a short help ('make' or 'make help') and the legal note.

	* trunk/thinpadTestStatic:
	* trunk/thinpadTestDynamic:
	The new executables are thinkpadTestStatic and thinkpadTestDynamic.
	Depends how you compile the program.

	* trunk/lib:
	* trunk/lib/static:
	* trunk/lib/dynamic:
	Adding the directory structure lib with the subdirectorys static and
	dynamic for the two types of librarys.

	* trunk/env-update:
	Adding the command 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(pwd)/lib/dynamic' to a
	seperate file. So you can set up the right library path with 'source
	env-update'.
